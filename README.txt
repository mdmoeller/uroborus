The following is an explanation of the various directories in the uroborus package.

--> src/ <-----
This directory contains all of the source code, java and python. It would be a good
idea to add this to your PATH and PYTHONPATH in order to use uroborus.

--> bin/ <-----
The Makefile is set to build the java binaries here.
It would be a good idea to add this to your CLASSPATH before using uroborus.
Also, one should probably do a make clean && make from src to refresh this.

--> ex/ <------
All of our examples are in this directory, along with the tests for them.

--> wr/ <------
The LaTeX source for the writeup is here.

--> doc/ <-----
The Makefile is set to output javadocs here.

--> tmp/ <-----
This is just a directory I used for playing around. Maybe I shouldn't have included it
in the submission.

--> .git/ <----
Our entire commit history!
